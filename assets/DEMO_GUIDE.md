Let's see it in action!"
```

**Part 1: Setup (60 seconds)**
```
[Screen: Terminal]

"Setting up PR Pilot is simple. Just three steps:

1. Clone the repository
   [Type: git clone https://github.com/sahilKumar1122/PR-Pilot.git]
   
2. Configure your environment
   [Show: cp env.example .env]
   [Show: editing .env with tokens]
   
3. Start with Docker
   [Type: docker compose up -d]
   [Show: Services starting]

And we're ready!"
```

**Part 2: GitHub Webhook Configuration (45 seconds)**

[Screen: GitHub repository settings]

"Now let's connect it to GitHub.

1. Go to your repo Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Add webhook
   
2. Enter your PR Pilot URL
   [Type: https://your-domain.com/webhooks/github]
   
3. Set content type to JSON
   [Click: application/json]

   [Click checkbox]
   
6. Save!
   [Click: Add webhook]

Perfect! Green checkmark means we're connected."
```

**Part 3: Live Demo (90 seconds)**
```
[Screen: GitHub - Creating a PR]

"Let's see it work. I'll create a pull request with some code changes.

[Create a branch]
[Make meaningful changes - add a feature]
[Commit and push]
[Open pull request]

And... within seconds, PR Pilot is already analyzing!

[Switch to terminal showing logs]

Look at what's happening:
- Fetching the PR diff from GitHub
- Running AI summarization
- Detecting risks
- Generating suggestions

[Switch back to GitHub PR]

And there it is! PR Pilot has posted a comprehensive analysis:

1. AI-generated summary - explains what this PR does
2. Classification - correctly identified this as a 'feature'
3. Files changed - lists all modified files
4. Risk assessment - flags potential concerns
5. Suggestions - recommends tests and documentation

All automatically, in under 60 seconds!"
```

**Part 4: Features Highlight (45 seconds)**
```
[Screen: Split screen showing different PR types]

"PR Pilot handles all types of PRs:

- Bug fixes [Show example]
- New features [Show example]
- Refactoring [Show example]
- Documentation [Show example]

It even has smart fallbacks - if AI models are slow or timeout,
it uses keyword-based analysis to ensure you always get results.

[Show: Architecture diagram from README]

The architecture is simple but powerful:
- FastAPI backend receives webhooks instantly
- Celery workers process analysis in background
- Redis handles the queue
- Everything runs in Docker containers"
```

**Outro (30 seconds)**
```
[Screen: README with badges and links]

"PR Pilot is open source, well-documented, and ready for production.

Check out:
- Complete API documentation
- Deployment guides for Docker and Cloud platforms
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

Star the repo, try it out, and let me know what you think!

Links in the description. Thanks for watching!"

## üöÄ Quick Demo (No Recording)

If you don't want to record a video right now, create a quick animated GIF:

**Using Terminalizer:**
```bash
npm install -g terminalizer

# Record
terminalizer record demo

# In the terminal:
# - Show docker compose up
# - Show curl to webhook
# - Show logs
# Exit: Ctrl+D

# Generate GIF
terminalizer generate demo
```

**Or use ScreenToGif** (Windows):
- Record just the PR comment appearing
- Export as GIF
- Much quicker than full video!
