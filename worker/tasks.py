Celery Tasks for PR Analysis

This is where the REAL work happens:
1. Fetch PR diff from GitHub API
2. Parse the diff (what files changed?)
3. Call AI models (summarization, classification)
4. Generate suggestions (commit message, tests)
5. Post comment back to GitHub

Why Celery?
- Handles long-running tasks (30+ seconds)
- Can retry failed tasks automatically
- Can scale workers horizontally
- Won't block the webhook endpoint
